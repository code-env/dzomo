# Tidyup

**tidyup** is a powerful command-line tool that organizes files in a specified directory into categorized subfolders. It offers multiple options to customize the organization process, ensuring your directories remain clean and structured.

---

## Features

- Organizes files into subfolders by:
  - **File Extensions** (e.g., `mp4`, `pdf`).
  - **Starting Names** (e.g., `project-a`, `report`).
  - **Creation Dates** (e.g., `2024-12-24`).
- Handles file naming conflicts automatically.
- Provides a detailed summary of the organization process.
- Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

---

## Installation

First, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

1. Install `tidyup` globally via npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g tidyup
   ```

2. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   tidyup --version
   ```

---

## Usage

Run the `tidyup` command, specifying the directory to organize and the desired options.

```bash
tidyup [directory] [options]
```

If no directory is specified, the current directory (`.`) is used by default.

### Options

- `--ext`: Organize files into folders based on their **file extensions**.
- `--name`: Group files by their **starting names**.
- `--date`: Group files by their **creation dates**.
- `--ignore-dotfiles`: Ignore dotfiles when organizing.

> **Note**: Some of these options cannot be used together. For example, you cannot use `--ext` and `--name` simultaneously, but you can use `--ignore-dotfiles` with any one other option.

## Examples

### Organize by File Extensions

```bash
tidyup /path/to/directory --ext
```

Example output:

```
Organization Summary for '/path/to/directory':
- Folder: mp4
  - Created
  - Files added: 3
- Folder: pdf
  - Already existed
  - Files added: 1
```

### Group Files by Starting Names

```bash
tidyup /path/to/directory --name
```

Example output:

```
Organization Summary for '/path/to/directory':
- Folder: project-a
  - Created
  - Files added: 4
- Folder: report
  - Already existed
  - Files added: 2
```

### Organize by Creation Dates

```bash
tidyup /path/to/directory --date
```

Example output:

```
Organization Summary for '/path/to/directory':
- Folder: 2024-12-23
  - Created
  - Files added: 2
- Folder: 2024-12-24
  - Already existed
  - Files added: 3
```

### Organize by Name and Ignore Dotfiles
```bash
tidyup /path/to/directory --name --ignore-dotfiles
```

Example output:

```
Organization Summary for '/path/to/directory':
- Folder: project-a
  - Created
  - Files added: 4
- Folder: report
  - Already existed
  - Files added: 2
```

### Invalid Option Combination
